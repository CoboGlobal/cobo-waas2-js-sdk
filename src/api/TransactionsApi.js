     * @param {String} [statuses] A list of transaction statuses, separated by comma. Possible values include:    - `Submitted`: The transaction is submitted.   - `PendingScreening`: The transaction is pending screening by Risk Control.    - `PendingAuthorization`: The transaction is pending approvals.   - `PendingSignature`: The transaction is pending signature.    - `Broadcasting`: The transaction is being broadcast.   - `Confirming`: The transaction is waiting for the required number of confirmations.   - `Completed`: The transaction is completed.   - `Failed`: The transaction failed.   - `Rejected`: The transaction is rejected.   - `Pending`: The transaction is pending. 
     * @param {String} [wallet_ids] A list of wallet IDs, separated by comma.
     * @param {String} [chain_ids] A list of chain IDs, separated by comma. The chain ID is the unique identifier of a blockchain. You can retrieve the IDs of all the chains you can use by calling [List enabled chains](/v2/api-references/wallets/list-enabled-chains).
     * @param {String} [token_ids] A list of token IDs, separated by comma. The token ID is the unique identifier of a token. You can retrieve the IDs of all the tokens you can use by calling [List enabled tokens](/v2/api-references/wallets/list-enabled-tokens).
     * @param {String} [asset_ids] (This concept applies to Exchange Wallets only) A list of asset IDs, separated by comma. An asset is a digital representation of a valuable resource on a blockchain network. Exchange Wallets group your holdings by asset, even if the same asset exists on different blockchains. For example, if your Exchange Wallet has 1 USDT on Ethereum and 1 USDT on TRON, then your asset balance is 2 USDT.
     * @param {String} [vault_id] The vault ID, which you can retrieve by calling [List all vaults](/v2/api-references/wallets--mpc-wallets/list-all-vaults). This parameter is applicable to MPC Wallets only.

     * @param {Number} [min_created_timestamp] The time when the transaction was created, in Unix timestamp format, measured in milliseconds. You can use this parameter to filter transactions created on or after the specified time.
     * @param {Number} [max_created_timestamp] The time when the transaction was created, in Unix timestamp format, measured in milliseconds. You can use this parameter to filter transactions created on or before the specified time.
     * @param {Number} [limit = 10)] The maximum number of objects to return. For most operations, the value range is [1, 50].
     * @param {String} [before] An object ID that serves as a starting point for retrieving data in reverse chronological order. For example, if you specify `before` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that end before the object with the object ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`.

     * @param {String} [after] An object ID that acts as a starting point for retrieving data in chronological order. For example, if you specify `after` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that start after the object with the object ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`.

    /**
     * List all transactions
     * This operation retrieves all the transactions under your organization.  You can filter the results by request ID, Cobo ID, transaction ID, transaction hash, type, status, and timestamps. You can also paginate and sort your query results. 
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {String} opts.request_id The request ID that is used to track a withdrawal request. The request ID is provided by you and must be unique within your organization.
     * @param {String} opts.cobo_ids A list of Cobo IDs, separated by comma. A Cobo ID can be used to track a transaction.
     * @param {String} opts.transaction_ids A list of transaction IDs, separated by comma.
     * @param {String} opts.transaction_hashes A list of transaction hashes, separated by comma.
     * @param {String} opts.types A list of transaction types, separated by comma. Possible values include:    - `Deposit`: A deposit transaction.   - `Withdrawal`: A withdrawal transaction.   - `TokenApproval`: A transaction that grants permission to access your tokens.    - `ContractCall`: A transaction that interacts with a smart contract.   - `TransactionFeePayment`: A transaction that is initiated by Fee Station to pay your transaction fee.   - `TransactionFeeRefund`: A transaction that refunds transaction fees to Fee Station.   - `MessageSign`: A transaction that signs a message.    - `MultiSig`: A transaction to a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe{Wallet}) that requires one or multiple signatures to be executed. 
     * @param {String} opts.statuses A list of transaction statuses, separated by comma. Possible values include:    - `Submitted`: The transaction is submitted.   - `PendingScreening`: The transaction is pending screening by Risk Control.    - `PendingAuthorization`: The transaction is pending approvals.   - `PendingSignature`: The transaction is pending signature.    - `Broadcasting`: The transaction is being broadcast.   - `Confirming`: The transaction is waiting for the required number of confirmations.   - `Completed`: The transaction is completed.   - `Failed`: The transaction failed.   - `Rejected`: The transaction is rejected.   - `Pending`: The transaction is pending. 
     * @param {String} opts.wallet_ids A list of wallet IDs, separated by comma.
     * @param {String} opts.chain_ids A list of chain IDs, separated by comma. The chain ID is the unique identifier of a blockchain. You can retrieve the IDs of all the chains you can use by calling [List enabled chains](/v2/api-references/wallets/list-enabled-chains).
     * @param {String} opts.token_ids A list of token IDs, separated by comma. The token ID is the unique identifier of a token. You can retrieve the IDs of all the tokens you can use by calling [List enabled tokens](/v2/api-references/wallets/list-enabled-tokens).
     * @param {String} opts.asset_ids (This concept applies to Exchange Wallets only) A list of asset IDs, separated by comma. An asset is a digital representation of a valuable resource on a blockchain network. Exchange Wallets group your holdings by asset, even if the same asset exists on different blockchains. For example, if your Exchange Wallet has 1 USDT on Ethereum and 1 USDT on TRON, then your asset balance is 2 USDT.
     * @param {String} opts.vault_id The vault ID, which you can retrieve by calling [List all vaults](/v2/api-references/wallets--mpc-wallets/list-all-vaults). This parameter is applicable to MPC Wallets only.
     * @param {String} opts.project_id The project ID, which you can retrieve by calling [List all projects](/v2/api-references/wallets--mpc-wallets/list-all-projects). 
     * @param {Number} opts.min_created_timestamp The time when the transaction was created, in Unix timestamp format, measured in milliseconds. You can use this parameter to filter transactions created on or after the specified time.
     * @param {Number} opts.max_created_timestamp The time when the transaction was created, in Unix timestamp format, measured in milliseconds. You can use this parameter to filter transactions created on or before the specified time.
     * @param {Number} opts.limit The maximum number of objects to return. For most operations, the value range is [1, 50]. (default to 10)
     * @param {String} opts.before An object ID that serves as a starting point for retrieving data in reverse chronological order. For example, if you specify `before` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that end before the object with the object ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGmk1`. You can set this parameter to the value of `pagination.before` in the response of the previous request.  - If you set both `after` and `before`, an error will occur.  - If you leave both `before` and `after` empty, the first page of data is returned.  - If you set `before` to `infinity`, the last page of data is returned. 
     * @param {String} opts.after An object ID that acts as a starting point for retrieving data in chronological order. For example, if you specify `after` as `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`, the request will retrieve a list of data objects that start after the object with the object ID `RqeEoTkgKG5rpzqYzg2Hd3szmPoj2cE7w5jWwShz3C1vyGSAk`. You can set this parameter to the value of `pagination.after` in the response of the previous request.  - If you set both `after` and `before`, an error will occur.  - If you leave both `before` and `after` empty, the first page of data is returned.
