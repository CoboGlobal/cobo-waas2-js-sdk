**assetId** | **String** | (This concept applies to Exchange Wallets only) The asset ID. An asset is a digital representation of a valuable resource on a blockchain network. Exchange Wallets group your holdings by asset, even if the same asset exists on different blockchains. For example, if your Exchange Wallet has 1 USDT on Ethereum and 1 USDT on TRON, then your asset balance is 2 USDT. |
