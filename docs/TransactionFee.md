**max_priority_fee_per_gas** | **String** | The maximum priority fee per gas unit used, in wei. The maximum priority fee represents the highest amount of miner tips that you are willing to pay for your transaction. | [optional] 
**gas_limit** | **String** | The maximum amount of gas your transaction is allowed to consume. | [optional] 
**gas_price** | **String** | The gas price, in wei. The gas price represents the amount of ETH that must be paid to validators for processing transactions per gas unit used. | [optional]
